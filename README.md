# IMARIS_to_LAM
## Author: Jack Morikka

This is a small program that uses .csv files saved from an IMARIS batch run and turns them into LAM ready folders.
Instructions:
* First select the IMARIS batch save output that should be a directory named e.g. 'Spots_1_Statistics'
* Then select the output folder
* Finally input a name for this 'spot' e.g. DAPI,GFP or MP.

**N.B.** this programme requires that the tiffs processed in IMARIS were named in the format: NAME_YYYY-MM-DD_XXXXXX.
This is what the tiffs are usually called when they are derived from the AUROX microscope.

* Once finished with 'Spots_1_Statistics', repeat for 'Spots_2_Statistics' making sure to choose the same output folder.
* Repeat for as many spots as you want to compare.
