# IMARIS_to_LAM

This is a small program that uses .csv files saved from an IMARIS batch run and turns them into LAM ready folders.
Instructions:
1. First select the IMARIS batch save output that should be a directory named e.g. 'Spots_1_Statistics'
1. Then select the output folder
1. Finally input a name for this 'spot' e.g. DAPI,GFP or MP.

**N.B.** this programme requires that the tiffs processed in IMARIS were named in the format: NAME_YYYY-MM-DD_XXXXXX.
This is what the tiffs are usually called when they are derived from the AUROX microscope.

1. Once finished with 'Spots_1_Statistics', repeat for 'Spots_2_Statistics' making sure to choose the same output folder.
1. Repeat for as many spots as you want to compare.
